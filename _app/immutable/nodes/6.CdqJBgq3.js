Again the approach was to quickly 'polish' a core experience to see how it would feel.
The game involves collecting / bumping into things of the same colour, and avoiding the opposite colour. Fill the gauge and you enter 'attack' mode where enemies fire bullets which when collected, shoot back at them.
There is a miniboss / challenge system, as well as run upgrades and bosses with more traditional bullet-hell type patterns.
This prototype felt much more fun and is one I would like to continue.

Most of the work for the PlayStation release involved converting Unreal Blueprints to C++ and optimising functionality based on guidelines.
Following from this, TEA worked on the PC / Steam port, during which most of my effort was on all the different types of gamepad controls to be supported, and making sure player drop-in and drop-out worked well with a combination of local (when a new gamepad is connected) and networked players.

There is only one input mechanic - move around the circle. The rest of the game involves collecting bits for points and to progress, and avoiding obstacles. Challenge phases were added to support awarding gems, which upon collecting all rewarded a jackpot inspired by pinball.
The controls never felt right, so I shelved the project to reuse some visual ideas later.
